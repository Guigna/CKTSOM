Description: a tool for defining, training and visualizing self-organizing trees. The training phase is based on the well known self-organizing maps (SOM) algorithm, a type of neural network that performs unsupervised learning, grouping multidimensional data. The graphic Visualization is focused on a scatterplot the shows the data being analized as long as the tree, showing the neurons (nodes) and the connections
